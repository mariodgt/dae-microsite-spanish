                    <h3>Australia, Queensland</h3>
                    <p><strong>Sun yourself on the golden sands of Surfers Paradise, snorkel through the technicolour treasures of the Great Barrier Reef and four-wheel drive Fraser Island. Explore the magical Daintree Rainforest with an Aboriginal guide or charter a yacht to the pristine Whitsunday Islands.  Enjoy relaxation in Noosa, frolic on the beaches of the Capricorn Coast and see dinosaur footprints near Winton. Visit wineries and rodeos in the country areas of Southern Queensland and go horse riding on Townsville's Magnetic Island. However you experience Queensland, the landscapes and lifestyle will never leave you. </strong><br /><br />Queensland, Australia - where approximately 300 sunny days a year and a year-round temperate climate are a way of life. Is it any wonder that Queenslanders are so inviting and friendly?<br /><br />In this vast state you'll find an amazing variety of experiences from World Heritage listed-Rainforests, to barren and sandy deserts and from tranquil tropical islands to the bright city lights. The idyllic climate means you'll be able to enjoy outdoor sports and alfresco dining at any time of the year you visit.<br /><br />Forge lasting memories when you witness unique Australian wildlife in native habitats, attempt skydiving or even follow in the footsteps of early pioneers in the Outback. Step back in time as you view Aboriginal rock art or attend a local exhibition at a regional gallery. And then there's the shopping, a favourite past-time for many. Markets, galleries, high-end boutiques and shopping centres all combine into a basket-load of shopping pleasure, so no matter whether you're looking to splurge or are bargain hunting, you'll be satisfied with the endless choices.<br /><br />Get ready to set your heart pounding with an exciting Queensland experience. Hours of sunshine and year-round tropical climates cultivate the Queensland people's love of sports and recreation. Play at some of Australia's best championship courses designed by golfing legends, or watch a professional Aussie Rules, cricket or rugby game. Or, you can always dress to impress at the horse races.<br /><br />Swim year-round in mild waters or kayak along ocean coves and spot dolphins as they swim by. Why not jet-ski around an island or take an exhilarating speedboat ride – this is the Queensland way of life, and it's not hard to get used to. And don't miss Queensland's premier sailing destinations and dive sites which are world-renowned.<br /><br />In Queensland you can abseil a city cliff or mountains in the Great Dividing Range, or go four-wheel driving in remote areas and feel the exhilaration as you race the tides along Queensland beaches. Hop on a motorbike on a working cattle farm, or travel through the heart of the state by camel. You can do all of this in Queensland as it offers plenty of challenges.<br /><br />Forget dusty museums and a tired exhibit, Queensland's arts scene is prolific. With accomplished artists and internationally-recognised art galleries, Queensland is quickly establishing itself as a leading destination for the arts. This development has been years in the making - thousands, in fact. Natural rock art galleries evidence Aboriginal artists from days gone by, or you can view more recent Aboriginal works at a gallery with the largest collection in Australia. Come and experience the cultural heritage of Queensland. Museums and memorials mark historic events and people to ensure they will not be forgotten. Former island convict settlements now reflect the hardships that early Australians endured, while gold-rush eras are remembered in old photographs reminiscent of times when towns tripled in size and everyone had gold fever.<br /><br />Queensland is about fun for all ages. With theme parks galore and so many beautiful places to visit, you'll never run out of things to do. Experience the thrill of rollercoasters that climb high in the sky and plummet to the ground in seconds – or if that's something only the kids want to do, you can sit back and just watch on.<br /><br />Here you can swim with dolphins, and even sharks, or hand-feed a koala. Appreciate fearsome crocodiles in safety from behind a fence or let an expert handler show you a snake. Wildlife parks offer interactive experiences, night tours and behind-the-scenes glimpses.<br /><br />And as for the food scene - Queensland offers a gourmet paradise with delectable, award-winning wines, organic produce and fresh seafood. Follow a food and wine trail and you'll be sipping on a Chardonnay or rolling a Shiraz around your mouth on a grape-fuelled adventure. Wineries are often located in picturesque settings and many offer the opportunity for picnics in grassy knolls overlooking vineyard slopes.<br /><br />You will experience nature at its finest in Queensland. With five World Heritage-listed areas and kilometres of ocean and natural landscapes you'll be truly amazed at the picture-perfect scenery. Queensland's preserved sites are recognised for their irreplaceable beauty. The 3,000 individual reefs and coral islands of the Great Barrier Reef harbour thousands of fish and marine creatures. While the World Heritage-listed rainforests of the Wet Tropics and Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves encompass the north and south of the State.<br /><br />Large tracks of significant dinosaur and fossil sites at Riversleigh in Mt Isa are testament to a former inland sea that once dominated Queensland's Outback. Just as the giant sand dunes and perched lakes of Fraser Island depict natural wonders like no other place in the world.<br /><br />Queensland has an abundance of native Australian wildlife. Watch the progression of protected humpback whales on their journey along the Queensland coast, and hold your breath while they play during the winter months. You can access this awesome spectacle from numerous points along the coast from the Gold Coast to the Whitsundays.<br /><br />Spot a platypus, or maybe another shy Australian mammal on a guided nocturnal tour, or experience a mob of kangaroos in the outback. The wildlife here is simply fascinating.<br /><br />Australia's second largest state is a land of natural treasures, cosmopolitan pleasures and refreshing hospitality. With so much going on in Queensland, you definitely won't run out of things to see or do, but you may run out of time.</p>

                    <h3>Australia, Queensland, Gold Coast</h3>
                    <p><strong>Australia's Gold Coast, with its sparkling beaches, lush rainforest hinterland, world-class entertainment facilities and huge array of attractions and activities, has regularly been dubbed 'the Coast with the Most'.</strong><br /><br />Take time out to sample the Gold Coast's laid-back beach culture with golden sands stretching for 70 kilometres.

                    <h3>Australia, Queensland, Magnetic Island</h3>
                    <p><strong>Magnetic Island is unlike any other island in Australia's tropical north, and is located just eight kilometres off Townsville, a modern city in North Queensland where you will find all the major facilities you could possibly need. But, hop on a ferry and take a 20-minute ride and another world awaits. Magnetic Island's relaxed tropical lifestyle, quiet secluded beaches, natural unspoilt beauty, abundant wildlife and easy access to the Great Barrier Reef offer a unique tropical experience.</strong><br /><br />Although in the Tropics, the Townsville area is in a rain shadow which makes it the sunniest city on the Queensland coast. With warm sunny days and only slight maximum temperature variations throughout the year, it is swimming season all year-round. Where the rocky headlands meet the sea, many secluded beaches have been formed, some of which can only be reached on foot or by boat.<br /><br />More than half of the Island's 5,184 hectares is National Park, with Mt Cook in the centre rising to 497 metres. Huge granite boulders are softened by tall Hoop pines, eucalypt forest and small patches of rainforest. There are 24 kilometres of walking tracks through the park with many spectacular lookouts. The National Park is a haven for wildlife, such as rock wallabies, possums, koalas and a wide variety of bird life.<br /><br />The range of activities available on the Island is both wide and varied. Whether young or old, seeking active pursuits or relaxation, there is a selection for everyone. Being in a naturally beautiful place, with such good weather, it is not surprising to find an abundance of water-based activities. These range from the exhilarating, like a jet-ski tour around the island, to absolute relaxation - sailing in a quiet bay.<br /><br />There is a choice of sailing and cruising trips all offering a relaxing day out on the water where you can swim, snorkel over coral reefs or just laze in the sun. You can even rent your own yacht. A great way to see the marine life is taking a guided sea kayak tour. The qualified instructor will show you the easy technique and from the solitude of your kayak you will explore beautiful bays and have the chance to see dolphins, turtles, coral reef fish and sea eagles.<br /><br />There are also sailing catamarans for hire, as well as sailboards, surf skis, canoes and aqua bikes, or how about water skiing or, skydiving on the beach? You can take a guided snorkelling or scuba diving tour, with all the gear you'll need available for hire.<br /><br />If you fancy a spot of fishing, then a guided fishing tour is for you. Other ways to take a tour of the island are by bus, taxi or Harley Davidson, or hire a colourful Mini Moke, trail bike, scooter or bicycle. The many ways to explore Magnetic Island are endless. There are also fun four-wheel drive tours.<br /><br />You will also find horse and pony riding, tennis and lawn bowls. For all golfing enthusiasts, a round at the Country Club in Picnic Bay is a must, (it is said to be where Greg Norman first played golf). Whichever club you choose, you will be made to feel very welcome at all the golf clubs on the Island.<br /><br />Located within the waters of the World Heritage-listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Magnetic Island has a wealth of interesting dive sites, whether diving from the shore or a boat. The waters around Magnetic Island are warm (winter average 23 degrees Celsius - summer average 28 degrees Celsius) and relatively shallow, absolute perfect conditions for novices or for relaxed, enjoyable diving.<br /><br />While not being able to boast the crystal-clear visibility of the Outer Great Barrier Reef, the beautiful bays and rocky headlands of the Island provide a home for fringing coral reefs and a wide variety of fish and other sea-life. Trips to the outer reef are available and are an experience not to be missed!<br /><br />There are also many shipwrecks to explore. Most ships were sunk as shelters to moorings or jetties but the Island's rocks have also claimed several vessels over the years.<br />The most famous wreck in this region is the Yongala off Cape Bowling Green, quoted as one of the best wreck dives in Australia and one of the top five in the world. It sank without trace during a cyclone in 1911 with the loss of all 120 passengers and crew.<br /><br />The wreck site was finally discovered in the early 1950s. It is 90 metres long and lies in about 30 metres of water, and a fantastic variety of coral and marine life live in the protected shelter. There are several day and extended trips available to the Yongala from the Island, and is an absolute must for the experienced diver.<br /><br />Almost anything can be purchased on Magnetic Island. There are shops in all four main residential bays, including boutiques, hair salons, newsagents, supermarket, sports store, service station, dive shops, DVD shops, chemist, souvenir shops, bakeries, butcher, real estate agents, travel agents, coffee shops, general stores, craft shop, galleries, post office and a credit union. Many shops have locally produced items and souvenirs for sale.<br /><br />Not only has Magnetic Island a good range of shops, but also a wide variety of excellent restaurants and many take-away places with special tropical menus. Whether dining in a softly-lit restaurant or eating take-away on the beach while watching the lights of Townsville, there is nothing quite like a balmy, tropical, island night on Magnetic.<br /><br />Many people consider Magnetic Island to be paradise. Just ask any of the locals, who wouldn't consider moving from this enchanting place. With relaxation as a top priority, make this destination a must on your holiday wish list.</p>
