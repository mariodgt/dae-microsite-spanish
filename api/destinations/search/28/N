It will take you approximately 30 minutes to walk to the top, depending on your fitness level, but it is well worth the effort.<br /><br />The untouched Tomaree National Park is blessed with many interesting landscapes and has excellent walking tracks. If you walk along the banks of the Tilligerry Creek you will almost be guaranteed a koala sighting.<br /><br /><strong>Worimi Conservation Lands</strong><br /><br />The Worimi Conservation Lands (Stockton Bight Sand Dunes) are truly one of nature's masterpieces and stretch for over 30 kilometres. Whatever your level of adventure is, the dunes offer something for everyone. You can explore by foot, in your own 4WD, ride a quad bike or join a 4WD tour and sandboard down thirty metre high dunes. You can also join a tag-along tour to master 4WD techniques.<br /><br />Some of the dunes, which are always changing, can reach up to 30 metres high. You can also discover Tin City, a makeshift collection of squatter-fishermen's tin homes, and the wreck of the Sygna.<br /><br /><strong>Nelson Head Heritage Lighthouse and Reserve</strong><br /><br />Explore this spectacular site with panoramic views of the entrance to Port Stephens. The museum houses interesting artefacts from its previous use as a lighthouse. Take in the panoramic views from the Inner Light Tea House while enjoying afternoon tea or a light lunch.<br /><br /><strong>Gan Gan Lookout</strong><br /><br />You can't miss a drive to the top of this magnificent lookout which takes in 360 degree views. Keep your eyes open for koalas, rare native birds and other wildlife and enjoy the impressive wildflower display, including giant Gymea lilies and native orchids in season.<br /><br /><strong>Take a boat to Tea Gardens</strong><br /><br />Hop on one of the water vessels and explore the other side of the Port. Once there you can wander around the shops at Tea Gardens and enjoy lunch on the banks of the Myall River. If it's cycling you enjoy, then a ride around the Tea Gardens will be ideal as the terrain is flat and perfect for getting around on a bike.<br /><br /><strong>Try the local produce</strong><br /><br />Pick up home-made products at the local roadside stalls. Try out local oysters, seafood, macadamias, figs, olives, wines and brews.<br /><br /><strong>Visit the surrounding islands</strong><br /><br />A day trip to Broughton Island or the local seal colony at Cabbage Tree Island will not disappoint. The reefs which surround Broughton Island are famous for snapper and jewfish. Broughton Island is located approximately eight nautical miles north-east of Port Stephens and is a part of the Myall Lakes National Park. There is a diverse range of marine life that can be spotted diving around the islands, including grey nurse sharks, wobbegong and Port Jackson sharks, crayfish, large cod, schools of baitfish and extensive sponge gardens.</p>

                    <h3>Australia, New South Wales, Yamba</h3>
                    <p><strong>Yamba is situated at the mouth of the Clarence River, the biggest river on the east coast of Australia, in Northern New South Wales. With a relaxed lifestyle and access to all services, it is within easy reach of Ballina, Lismore and Grafton and only three hours' drive from Brisbane and two hours from the Gold Coast. Stretching from Wooli in the South to Evans Head in the North, the Clarence Valley offers an amazing variety of headlands and beaches, which are easily accessible in comparison to other stretches of the New South Wales coast.</strong><br /><br />Whether it's offshore sailing you are into, or meandering along the Clarence River to drop anchor, the waterways of the Lower Clarence offer endless days of adventure. More than 100 islands lie upstream from the mouth of the river in unpolluted waters with an abundance of fish and nature.<br /><br />Both nationally acclaimed Clarence River seafood and Angourie's popular surf break entice culinary and sports enthusiasts to Yamba. Whether it's fine dining in award-winning restaurants, fresh catches from the ocean or just a good old fashioned pub meal, you'll have a great selection of restaurants and cafes within Yamba to choose from.<br /><br />One of the major attractions of Yamba and surrounds is its natural beauty. Yamba is fortunate to have two National Parks and a world heritage listed nature reserve on its doorstep.<br /><br />To the south is the Yuraygir National Park, consisting of 30,406 hectares, 60 kilometres of cliffs and rocky headlands, pristine beaches and lake systems just waiting to be explored. This National Park is unique because it is where the temperate south and tropical north overlap creating a diverse range of flora and fauna.<br /><br />If you go north across the river mouth from Yamba you will find the Iluka Nature Reserve, the largest remaining stand of littoral rainforest in New South Wales. This valuable remnant (136 hectares) of what was once an extensive coastal rainforest is World Heritage listed with the Iluka Nature Reserve home to 140 bird species.<br /><br />North of Yamba lies 38 kilometres of coastline including one of the last wild rivers in New South Wales, the Esk. Incorporating the Bundjalung National Park there are 20,116 hectares of coastal heathlands, rainforest, lagoons, swamps and cypress stands waiting to be discovered.<br /><br />On the must see list are the Yamba Lighthouse, Main Beach salt water swimming pool, boat harbour marina/trawlers, Port of Yamba Historical Society Museum, Arthouse Australia Art Gallery, Gorman's Oyster Farm, and a ride on the water ferry to Iluka.<br /><br />Yamba and the Lower Clarence offer a diverse and exhausting range of artisans in residence. From acclaimed artists, stained glass practitioners, to the downright clever, there is so much on offer in Yamba and its surrounds.<br /><br />Maclean, a 20 minute drive west of Yamba, has alfresco dining, beautifully-restored federation buildings, Ferry Park Gallery and Tourist Information Centre, the Maclean Lookout (which overlooks the Clarence River to the Pacific Ocean), the Pinnacle Rock formation, and the Ulgundahi Art and Culture Centre.<br /><br />Take a trip to Byron Bay, just one-and-a-half hours' scenic drive north, and travel the coastal road through Ballina, Lennox Head and Suffolk Park. Byron Bay is truly a unique and colourful place to visit and shop. Join in with the cafe latte set or take a trek to the most eastern point in Australia - the Byron Bay Lighthouse. If you prefer more of nature, then travel to Byron's hinterland and climb Mount Warning at Uki.<br /><br />Due to its unique peninsular geography, uncrowded and pristine beaches wrap the coastline creating a water sports haven. Once holiday-makers discover Yamba's abundant natural beauty they return year after year to explore the magnificent waterways, stroll the uncrowded beaches, go swimming, fishing or surfing, but most of all discover Yamba's friendly hospitality all year-round.<br /><br />There is a single word for Yamba's climate – perfection – and it has the distinction, along with two other coastal areas on the world map, San Diego in California and Bunbury in Western Australia - to have been declared by the CSIRO and Stanford University as having the best climate in the world to work, live and play.<br /><br />In Yamba there is never a wrong time of the year to throw some more of those famous, ocean fresh Yamba prawns on the barbecue.<br /><br />During the winter months, Yamba is much quieter than during the peak summer months and there is an endless succession of sunny, windless days to enjoy river, beach and sporting clubs.<br /><br />In the summer the nor'easter arrives most days around noon and cools the town off in a far more effective and pleasant manner than air-conditioning ever could.<br /><br />People swim in the ocean at Yamba all year-round, and in fact the water is often warmer in July than it is in February due to a warm current finding its way down the coast at that time.<br /><br />Being surrounded by Yuraygir National Park allows for plenty of opportunity to get back to nature and discover the beauty of coastal heaths (keep your eyes out for the unique coastal emus), spot whales from the Shelley Beach walk or paddle the meanderings of the mighty Clarence river system.<br /><br />Fishing or boating is well-catered for, as well as something for history buffs and photographers, art lovers, lawn bowlers and golfers. Whatever your interests are, you will find them in Yamba.<br /><br />There are some attractions in Yamba that you shouldn't miss and these include the Yamba Ligththouse, also known as Clarence River Light, the Story House Museum, Yuraygir and Bundjalung National Parks and the surf beach at Angourie.<br /><br />Another area that shouldn't be missed is Pippi Beach. This is an idyllic location to soak up the sun and enjoy the crashing waves of the Pacific Ocean. It is a popular surfing beach which has a large number of enthusiastic surfing competitors who turn up each year for the annual Pippi Beach Surf Classic. Pippi is also patrolled by the local surf club in season.<br /><br />Fishing off the rock shelf on the northern end at Yamba Point and the southern end at Flat Rock is another popular past-time for locals and visitors. Picnic tables, parking and toilet facilities are all available.</p>

                    <h3>Australia, New South Wales, Forster - Tuncurry</h3>
                    <p><strong>The Great Lakes Region is a natural paradise, stretching from Hawks Nest in the south to Forster and Tuncurry in the north and encompasses Wallis, Smiths and Myall Lakes. It is celebrated for its magnificent coastline, numerous national parks and state forests and basks in a year-round temperate climate.</strong><br /><br />Forster and Tuncurry, located 312 kilometres north of Sydney, are now essentially one conglomerate city separated by a very large concrete bridge. They sit on opposite sides of the entrance to Wallis Lake which is 26 kilometres long. Thus the two towns are fronted by the ocean to the east and the lake to the west.<br /><br />The stunning waters that surround Forster Tuncurry are enjoyed by many, and offer all kinds of watersports activities for all the family, including swimming, fishing, surfing, whale watching, diving and water skiing.<br /><br />There are a number of great beaches to choose from. The Bar is located at the southern end of Nine Mile Beach which extends northwards from Tuncurry to Hallidays Point. It is a good surfing area with a rock pool, grassed areas, a children's playground, and a pleasant bathing and picnic area with barbecue facilities. You can walk out to the end of the breakwater where dolphins can sometimes be seen at play.<br /><br />A little further east is The Tanks, an unusual rock formation where the waves spray water into a protected safe swimming area. Further east again is Bennetts Head which is named after the family who built a home at the foot of the headland in 1864. There is a lookout with views south over One Mile Beach, west over the hinterland and north to Manning Point. A paved walkway provides a scenic walk.<br /><br />Burgess Beach is a small and quiet beach accessed by a steep path. It is a good spot for families with shelter on three sides and plenty of small rock cave formations.<br /><br />You'll find many picnic areas are scattered around the shores of picturesque Wallis Lake, which is famous for the superb oysters that are farmed from this region. There is a modern harbour at Forster and a full range of marine services that enhance the lake's recreational potential. Hire a boat, launch your own or take a cruise on Wallis Lake. Also look out for pelicans, pied oyster catchers, cormorants and majestic black swans.<br /><br />A short drive away you'll find Cape Hawke, one of the most northerly points of Booti Booti National Park. There is a very steep 440 metre path which winds its way to the summit of the hill. Thankfully there are several rest benches en route. As you ascend the headland the views are increasingly spectacular. At the apex (233 metres above sea level) is a cairn noting that Captain Cook sighted and named Cape Hawke on May 12, 1770. A raised viewing platform affords quite spectacular views north along the coast over Forster to Hallidays Point, north-west to the meeting of the Wang Wauk River and Wallis Lake, west to the Great Dividing Range and south along the spit.<br /><br />For motoring enthusiasts and history buffs, The Curtis Collection consists of vintage cars, including the first Australian car, motorcycles, horse-drawn vehicles (including the original Cobb &amp; Co stage coach), telephones, cameras, toys, police displays, bottles, musical instruments and artefacts from the two World Wars.<br /><br />If you're a keen golfer Forster/Tuncurry offers two first-class 18 hole golf courses; one at Tuncurry with and another 18 hole course in Forster situated adjacent to One Mile Beach. Both feature modern air-conditioned clubhouses for you to relax in after a round of golf.<br /><br />For more hedonistic pursuits, you'll find many superb seafood restaurants, relaxing outdoor cafes, and some really exciting specialty shops, plus plenty of arts and crafts, with many galleries and antique shops to browse through.<br /><br />The Great Lakes Region is one of the state's largest coastal lake systems - a Ramsar Wetland of International Significance - and 40 kilometres of beaches and rolling sand dunes make Myall Lakes one of the most visited parks in Australia. The Grandis, a magnificent 76 metre high flooded gum, is one of the tallest trees in the state.<br /><br />Wallignat National Park offers one of the best natural viewing platforms on the central coast, Whoota Lookout, which provides magnificent views of 100 kilometres of coastline from Port Macquarie to Port Stephens. The park contains Eucalypt forests supporting a number of threatened plant (cabbage palm and flooded gum forests) and animal species.<br /><br />Some of the animals that inhabit the park are Green Tree Frog, Jervis Bay Tree Frog, Peron's Tree Frog, White-bellied Sea-Eagle, Grey Butcherbird, Glossy Black-Cockatoo, Regent Honeyeater, Powerful Owl, Parma Wallaby, New Holland Mouse, Yellow-bellied Glider, Grey-headed Flying-fox, Stephen's Banded Snake and the Diamond Python.<br /><br />Graced by the stunning surf of Blackhead Beach, and majestic Norfolk pines planted by two generations of tree-lovers in the early 1920's and in 1946, Hallidays Point has long been a favourite fishing and leisure spot.<br /><br />The natural beauty of the town has been enhanced with a rainforest walk linking Red Head and Black Head promontories, the walk embraces striking coastal landforms and littoral rainforest remnants. The bush tracks off the main walk lead visitors through bush that hosts a delicate balance of flora and fauna, and have been designed to accommodate people of all fitness levels.<br /><br />For a laid back holiday in one of Australia's most beautiful and accessible areas, you can't go past Forster/Tuncurry and the surrounding Great Lakes Region.</p>
