        <h4 class="tab-title"><span>New South Wales</span><br>Destination Overview</h4>
        <a id="resortAvailability" class="button medium ghost right see-availability">SEE AVAILABILITY</a>
        <p>New South Wales has endless unspoilt beaches, breathtaking natural treasures and one of the world's most famous and vibrant cities. Climb Sydney Harbour Bridge or take the ferry past the Opera House to Manly. Do a day trip to the Hunter Valley vineyards or the romantic Blue Mountains. Relax on the beach in Byron Bay and see dolphins play in the clear waters of Jervis Bay. Visit the world's oldest ceremonial burial site at Mungo National Park. Horse ride, hike or hit the snowfields in the Snowy Mountains or head west for Tamworth's country music and Moree's natural artesian spas.<br /><br />Sydney is Australia's largest and most famous city and is home to beautiful beaches, iconic buildings, historic landmarks, award-winning restaurants and a uniquely vibrant culture.  From the breathtaking views of Sydney Harbour to the serene tranquillity of Hyde Park and the historic streets and cobblestoned lanes of The Rocks area, you will find Sydney a truly cosmopolitan city.<br /><br />Sydney Harbour, with its magnificent Opera House and Harbour Bridge is one of the most photographed locations in the world. Take a stroll along Circular Quay and soak up the atmosphere, or catch a ferry to Cockatoo Island or Watsons Bay and enjoy the beauty of the harbour and its surroundings. As well as being a main transport hub, Circular Quay has some of Sydney's best restaurants.<br /><br />In the heart of the CBD in Sydney is the Queen Victoria Building, another must-see attraction. Dating back to the 1890s, this grand and beautiful building is one of the city's premier shopping destinations. Darling Harbour is only a ten minute stroll from Sydney Town Hall and is the perfect place to entertain the whole family. Here you can enjoy a delicious harbour-side meal, or experience Sydney's energetic nightlife. Darling Harbour is also where you'll find the Chinese Gardens of Friendship, the SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium and the WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo.<br /><br />For a bird's eye view of Sydney, head to the summit of Sydney Tower Eye. You will enjoy views stretching across the city centre, out to the Pacific Ocean and west to the Blue Mountains. Thrill seekers should try the Sydney Skywalk experience, a moving, glass-floored viewing platform at the top of Sydney Tower Eye. Also at the top is a banquet-style restaurant with 360 degree views of the city. Another must-do is to climb the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Apart from the feeling of accomplishment you'll get when reaching the middle of the ‘giant coat hanger', the views are incomparable.<br /><br /><strong>Blue Mountains</strong><br />A trip to New South Wales would not be complete without a visit to the Blue Mountains. Less than two hours from Sydney by road or train, the World Heritage Listed Blue Mountains are one of the country's most spectacular icons, with picturesque villages, breathtaking views and great restaurants. The Blue Mountains National Park is unique in its history, wildlife and world-famous scenery and includes the Grose Wilderness, dedicated for its wild unspoilt natural beauty.<br /><br />The iconic Three Sisters rock formation is a Blue Mountains must-see. Head down the path to the Three Sisters Walk, or for the more adventurous, walk down the Giant Stairway of 980 steps to the valley floor. You can follow the path around past Katoomba Falls and return to the top via the Scenic Railway.<br /><br />The Jenolan Caves are Australia's most impressive limestone caves. Situated in the Blue Mountains wilderness, nine show caves are open to the public and the complex system is one of the largest underground cave systems in the world and was recently proclaimed the world's oldest open cave system.<br /><br /><strong>The Central Coast</strong><br />From Broken Bay at the mouth of the Hawkesbury River to south of Newcastle, the Central Coast includes a mix of bays and inlets, pristine beaches, lakes and lush hinterland. While Gosford is the main centre, picturesque villages along the coastline such as Pearl Beach, Ettalong, Hardys Bay, Avoca Beach, Terrigal, Toowoon Bay, The Entrance and Forresters Beach are popular spots. There is beautiful scenery at Somersby Falls in Brisbane Water National Park and don't miss a visit to the secluded beaches and bays of Bouddi National Park.<br /><br /><strong>The Hunter</strong><br />The Hunter includes the towns, vineyards and National Parks of the Hunter Valley, the Upper Hunter and Barrington Tops. With more than 150 wineries, the Hunter Valley produces some terrific wines, loved at home and overseas. If you enjoy good food and wine, you'll enjoy the Hunter where you can join a winery tour, a cooking school and sample wines from boutique winemakers to the ‘blue bloods' of the industry. Other things to do include pampering at a day spa, teeing off from a championship golf course or taking a hot-air balloon ride over the vineyards. Just follow the Legendary Pacific Coast touring route to uncover the best of the region.  Nearby Barrington Tops National Park is a World Heritage natural wonder.<br /><br /><strong>Snowy Mountains</strong><br />Hit Australia's highest ski slopes at Charlotte Pass and climb Mt Kosciuszko, Australia's tallest peak. At the top you'll find a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve with 20 species of plants not to be found anywhere else in the world. In winter, carve up the snow at fields such as Thredbo and Perisher Blue and in summer, take in the trout-filled streams and wildflower-coated plains. You can go cycling, caving, rafting, kayaking, four-wheel driving, horse riding and hiking.<br /><br /><strong>North Coast</strong><br />Iconic Byron Bay takes in a cluster of surf beaches to the north and south of Cape Byron, the most easterly point in Australia. If you love surfing, you'll enjoy the lively surfing counterculture here as well as great waves and plenty of opportunities to learn to surf in a beautiful environment. You can also spot humpback whales! In the Tweed Valley, you can fish the Tweed River and see the southern hemisphere's biggest eroded volcanic crater. On the rainforest-fringed North Coast, classic Aussie surf culture mingles with World Heritage Listed National Parks, hinterland villages and great food and wine.<br />Image<br /><br /><strong>Coffs Harbour</strong><br />Located halfway between Sydney and Brisbane, the sub-tropical climate, tranquil rainforests and clean uncrowded beaches of Coffs Harbour make it one of the most popular family holiday destinations on the North Coast.<br /><br /><strong>South Coast</strong><br />The South Coast has 30 National Parks, marine parks and reserves, as well as gorgeous beaches, and a rich Aboriginal history to explore. Cruise the pristine Clyde River in Batemans Bay, or try award-winning cheeses at Bega and watch whales in Eden on the Sapphire Coast, near the Victorian border.<br /><br />With powder fine sand and clear turquoise waters the beaches of Jervis Bay are among the safest and most beautiful in the world. At its southern end, Jervis Bay is enclosed by the pristine wilderness of Booderee National Park. From Wreck Bay village in the Park's south, a walking trail circles the peninsula to St Georges Head passing a succession of quiet beaches, cliffs and forests. Hyams Beach officially has the world's whitest sand. The many beaches, lagoons, secret coves and hidden creeks of Jervis Bay are perfect for all types of aquatic activities.
